          Let's cut the bulshit, we don't need 99% of the fancy kitchen
          equipement. However that being said we do need some things, see the
          list below. Oh and don't give a shit what brand as long as it does the
          function required. All of these items can be purchased in Ikea, large
          Lidl or Tesco for approximately €40.
