          I'm so tired of the endless tutorials where professional chef's make
          recipes requiring expert knowledge and equipment all look so easy.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm also tired of making aforementioned recipes and wasting a bunch of
          ingredients because it rarely works out. So fuck off with your 15
          minute meals in a massive, fully equiped kitchen, with a professional
          skill set.
        </p>

        <p>
          Ultimately I'm tired of the pretense. Home cooking isn't easy,
          it's a skill that takes years to learn. You may have gathered, I'm no
          professional chef and nor do I have a large kitchen and nor is it
          fully equipped.
        </p>

        <p>
          Alas, I also want to eat home cooked, health meals, without breaking
          the bank and having to go to culinary school to do so.

          My mission is to bring you the easiest and laziest cooking methods and
          techniques for healthier, cheaper eating.
