          <h1>What's my beef?</h1>
          <p>
            I've become exhausted of professional chefs writing pretenious cook
            books and posting endless video tutorials, requiring expert
            knowledge and equipment, making complex skills look easy. Alas, I
            also want to eat healthily, without having to go to culinary school
            to do so.
          </p>
          <h1>Mission</h1>
          <p>
            My mission is to bring you the easiest and lazist cooking methods
            and techniques for healthy(ier) meals.
